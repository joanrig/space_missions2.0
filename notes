TO DO
fix formatting of dates ie "Launch Date: June 20, 200812,46 a.m. PDT (07,46 UTC)"
get Mission.set_targets working
*fix CLI so after missions are listed, you have the choice of other commands besides picking a mission number or exiting.


____________________________________________________________

possible future features:
search missions by launch, landing date or type

add to user_says

#elsif input == "type"
#  SpaceMissions::Mission.type
# elsif input == "launch"
#   SpaceMissions::Mission.launch
# elsif input == "end"
#   SpaceMissions::Mission.end

add to mission class:
#futre featues
# def self.find_by_launch_date(input)
#   missions = @@all.select {|mission| mission.launch_date.split.last == input}
# end
#
# def self.find_by_end_date(input)
#   missions = @@all.select {|mission| (mission.end_date || mission.mission.end.date).split.last == input}
#end

establish separate classes for Type
